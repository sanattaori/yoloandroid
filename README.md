# My Eyes

Project developed as part of rajasthan hackathon 5.0

My Eyes helps blind see real world and find out new things, And read document with OCR. I used YOLOv3 object detection along with  TensorFlow Mobile which Accurately detects object in real time and reads description about them in real time.

It is not a complete functioning project, some very basic functionalities have been implemented.

I would be working more to make the project efficient and nicer and complete as and when time permits.
